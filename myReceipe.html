    <h2>One-Pot Broccoli Cheese Pasta</h2>
    <img src="CheesePasta.jpg" alt="Cheese Pasta" width="200" />
    <p>
      We love an easy one-pot dinner for the simplicity and the cleanup. This
      one-pot creamy pasta is kind of like the grown-up version of mac & cheese,
      but even easier and better. The broccoli is in no way hidden, but it's a
      great way to sneak in an extra serving of greens, and even the pickiest of
      eaters will eat their vegetables if they are coated in cheese. ðŸ˜‰ Throw
      everything together, and you've got yourself a delicious, no-fuss meal in
      a little more then 30 minutes.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>1 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>1 small yellow onion, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>1 medium head broccoli, cut into small florets</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add onions and cook until
        soft, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1
        minute more.
      </li>

      <li>
        Add pasta and broccoli, then stir in water and half-and-half. Season
        with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Bring to a boil, reduce heat
        and let simmer, stirring occasionally, until pasta is al dente, 12 to 14
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Add cheeses and stir until melted.</li>
    </ol>
